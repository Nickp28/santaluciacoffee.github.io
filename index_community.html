		<h1>These Farms provide us with the premuim quality coffee cherries</h1>

		<h3 class="block-quote">"These cherries produce a great cup, allowing us to support better ways of life for many connected to these farms."</h3>
		<hr class="line-block-thick">

		<p>As we source our beans we have always believed in Farm responsibility and with fair pricing, we always pay a premium to the grower for their beans. Giving back to the workers and their families is something we are proud of and is a huge incentive in our world. The Farms provides us with the beautiful premium coffee cherries that produce a great cup allowing us to support better ways of life for many connected to the Farms. Additionally as we support the city that drinks our coffee most (Washington DC area), Santa Lucia participates with many charities in the tri-state area annually. Stop by one of these great Chef driven events, sample a cup and say hello!</p>
		<h2>What our customers are saying</h2>
		<p>“More than a decade ago, what first grabbed our attention when introduced to Santa Lucia Estate coffee was that it was high mountain, farm direct and sustainable. That level of quality is seen both in the product and the way they operate their business. William Gutierrez and his team are wonderful people who we not only enjoy working with, but enjoy the ways in which they work.
			They are gracious, informative about how they raise and harvest the beans, and they have made incredible efforts to give back by building schools for the children of the workers. It is a truly sustainable concept—not only through the preservation of the rain forest and the respect for the land, but for the community involvement and outreach.”
