Yet, Santa Lucia is a uniquely integrated Direct Trade program known for its distinct quality and exceptional cup.  Without any middleman we have kept out one level of distribution and it has allowed us keep costs lower and offer our premium product at a more affordable price.</p>

		<h2>Types of espresso</h2>
		<hr class="medium-line">
		<p class="coffee-details">By definition, espresso is relatively simple: 1 ounce of coffee beverage made from 7 grams of ground beans or single POD, brewed at 9 bar of
			pressure (130 psi) at roughly 200 degrees F. Plus or minus. Espresso is both brewing process and beverage invented by the Italians in 1884,
			its name implying speed and singularity of purpose and traditionally you drink it quickly. Below are a few examples of espresso drinks that
			you be asked to create.</p>
