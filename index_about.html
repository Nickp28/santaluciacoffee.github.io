		<p class="story">Chardonnay…Mondavi, Barbaresco…Gaja, now you can select the coffee you
			drink the way you select fine wine and other cared for, farm direct specialty food
			products. Santa Lucia Estate Coffee is the response to America’s smarter and more
			demanding consumer, and the coffee which America’s better, and more savvy
			hotels and restaurants are serving today.The large turnaround in the Washington area market can be credited to the
			introduction of the Santa Lucia Estate Coffee program and the efforts of William
			Gutierrez. Teaming with the vision of a fine coffee roaster in New York David
			Dallis, then President of Dallis Coffee the pair gained the support of believers in
			this new concept. It took the attention of Chefs like Roberto Donna, Jeffrey
			Buben, Robert Wiedmaier in Washington, DC and Danny Meyer and Douglas
			Rodriguez in New York City to launch the confidence in the industry and begin a
			new direction in the important finish to a diner’s meal.</p>

			<p class="story">It was Twenty Four years ago (1994) when Gutierrez, a Nicaraguan native living in
				Washington DC and importer of Sesame Seeds was looking into the possibility
				of importing additional Nicaraguan goods. Coffee was one of the products which
				had suffered by the US embargo during his country’s 10 year Sandinista
				revolution-but it had once had a wonderful reputation in the US market. To
				confirm his ideas he headed to the annual Specialty Coffee Association Trade
				Show and met David Dallis, incoming President of SCAA who was a leading
				roaster based in New York. <span>David’s vision for his presidency was twofold: to
					develop the concept of estate coffees and to improve coffee in the restaurant
					setting.</span></p>

					<p class="story">Gutierrez and Dallis started their exploration by meeting with Roberto Donna of
						four star Galileo Restaurant and discovering how mediocre the coffee served at
						his flagship restaurant was. Coffee was never a priority and this same fact would
						continue to be the common thread in most of the better restaurants visited by
						Gutierrez. Thus a niche was found: Chefs were not very educated on coffee, and
						were definitely not paying attention to this flavor
						With this door now open Gutierrez began visiting other “Friends” at the
						restaurants of the time: like Greggory Hill at Gabriel and Jeffrey Buben at Vidalia.
						Talk about his program began with no advertising or additional sales force: only
						word of mouth and community participation. Mr. Gutierrez began the Santa
						Lucia Washington Restaurant program and today it boasts many of the city’s best
						hotels and restaurants. Beans are hand picked and delivered to the consumer
						without being mixed or blended with inferior product. Similar to grapes used for
						wine production, the same is true for estate coffee: graded in the sorting process
						only the best beans of these select farms wind up in Estate Coffee.
						The coffee program has been recognized locally and nationally and opened eyes
						to the changing face of coffee in the restaurant setting today. <span>Truly differentiating
							this coffee program clients are James Beard Award winners, Four Star Chefs,
							Fine Hotels and those with a common goal: to offer the best, for their bistros,
							cafés or fine dining room settings.</span></p>

							<p class="story">The future for Santa Lucia Estate Coffee and the Estate coffee world can only be
								more exciting. New customers with more educated palates bring more requests
								for the bright cup of coffee at the end of the meal. Even food critics are
								beginning to acknowledge coffee in their reviews.
								The art of coffee has come a long way—but with a long way to go. To continue
								this mission in early 2003 Gutierrez asked his wife Jodi Lehr to join him in the
								business-and with her belief in a good cup of coffee and all that is behind this
								fresh from the farm concept she joined the team. On March 1, 2008 Gutierrez
								and Lehr separated their ties with Dallis Coffee and opened the Santa Lucia
								Distribution Center in the Washington Metropolitan area partnering with New
								York based El Dorado Roasters. The next chapter in the story began...
